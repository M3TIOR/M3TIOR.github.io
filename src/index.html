            <p>
                I'm a programmer, philosopher, artist, musician, you name it. But I guess
                you could simplify the statement to <b><i>really negative academic...</i></b>
                If you've seen my work then you know I'm the kind of person who puts their best
                effort into everything they do. The most optimized code. The widest variety of
                muscial genres, and harmonizing chords. The heart that's poured into all of my
                art. Hell, I spend day's pondering deep questions like <i>"how does quantum
                physics play a part in our thoughts and actions?"</i> But I
                should probably let my work speak for itself rather than talk
                away a good reputation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had an interrest in everything electronics
                since I got my hands on my first laptop back in elementary school.
                I guess you could say it was the most <b>elementary</b> thing about
                me back then. Which eventually evolved into an interest in complex
                mathmatics, data science, and so on as I explored the wide world of
                gaming and the internet when I'd eventually aquired them. My original
                laptop was a toy, but the real root of my beginning started back in 2011,
                my freshman year of high school.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first year of high school, I convinced my mother to buy me a $700
                laptop so I could use it for doing homework, when my true intent
                had been to use it for gaming; not unlike alot of my fellow classmates.
                One of my closest friends, <a href="https://github.com/raacer">raacer</a>,
                used to use batch scripts to screw with the schools computers because the
                school hadn't yet cracked down on batch execution. I will admit
                my interest was peeked, so, I asked him where he learned to program. He
                told me to Google <i>"batch scripting"</i>, which up until then, googling
                things was a bit of a foreign concept to me.
                Use Google as an educational resource? Poppycock! Why educate myself
                when that's what my teachers were for? I'm glad to say I ended up googling
                it out of spite anyway, only to find out I had absolutely no idea what
                I was doing. So I spent freshman year wondering how the hell batch scripts
                in windows worked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sophomore year started with my eyes on the new videogame programming class
                <a href="skyview.vansd.org" alt="Skyview High School">my highschool</a>
                offered. I was knee high
                in paperwork debaiting wether or not I wanted to join the skyview robotics
                team as well, but I decided to limit myself to the prior so I'd have room
                to breath. Well, that and I was lazy as all hell. Between having to listen
                to my teachers talk and my mother scream her head off at me every night all
                I really wanted was some time alone to be quiet and content for once. That
                video game programming class is where I originally picked up the C language.
                The teacher taught it to the best of her ability, though nobody really knew
                what we were doing, so I lacked the understanding I'd craived since I started
                the school year. When the end of the school year rolled around, I asked my
                teacher what programming language I needed to learn to be on the programming
                sub-team of Skyview's 2811; so, I ended up learning Java over the summer.

                By now you're probably thinking, "But M3TIOR, why do we need to know this?"
                You don't need to know this. Just shut up and let me ramble already. But I
                digress, If you want me to cut to the chase, I really only put together my
                skills as a whole recently. As of August 1, 2016. I became a reinvented woman.
                Which is what I've been meaning to make a return to. Below you can find my most
                recent work. If you want to hire me, shoot an email to
                <a href="">cplusplusook@gmail.com</a> or if I've applied to work beneath you,
                then I really have no advice for you.
